# Anomaly Detection Convolutional Neural Network Architecture

## üìå Project Overview

This project explores the use of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) for anomaly detection in image data. It focuses on building a custom CNN architecture to classify and detect anomalies in a dataset of images, leveraging techniques like data preprocessing, training-validation splitting, and model evaluation using accuracy and visualizations.

## üîç Key Components

### 1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration
- Data is loaded, resized, and normalized.
- Exploratory visualizations are used to understand the distribution and structure of the dataset.

### 2. Model Architecture
- A custom CNN is designed from scratch using layers like `Conv2D`, `MaxPooling2D`, `Dropout`, and `Dense`.
- The model is compiled with appropriate loss and optimizer functions.

### 3. Training and Evaluation
- The model is trained with training and validation datasets.
- Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, loss, and visual plots (e.g., confusion matrix) are used to assess performance.

### 4. Anomaly Detection Logic
- A specialized routine is implemented to flag anomalies based on classification thresholds or reconstruction errors (depending on the task).
